Your goal was to display a formatted message using a combination of literal and variable values.

Using basic C# syntax, you created literal values of several different data types. You declared variables, and also set and retrieved values from those variables. You also initialized variables, and learned how to use the var keyword to implicitly type a variable by inferring the type from the initialization.

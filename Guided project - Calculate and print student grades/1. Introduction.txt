Developers perform some tasks nearly every day. Tasks including declaring string and numeric variables, assigning and extracting values, and performing calculations are routine, but essential. Equally important is the task of communicating results to the application user. Mastering the ability to apply these skills to solve a given problem is something that every developer must learn to do.

Suppose you are a teacher's assistant at a school. You're tasked with developing an application that automates student grading. The application uses all of the scored assignments for each student to calculate their current overall grade/score for the class. The teacher has also provided a required format for reporting the student grades.

This module will guide you through the steps required to develop your Student Grading application. Your code will declare and assign values to variables based on student names, perform various numeric calculations, and display the results. Calculations include determining the sum of assignment scores and calculating the current grade for each student. To display the results in the required format, you'll use Console.WriteLine(), as well character escape sequences that will help format your results.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to write code that uses various variable types, performs numeric calculations, and displays formatted data for the user.

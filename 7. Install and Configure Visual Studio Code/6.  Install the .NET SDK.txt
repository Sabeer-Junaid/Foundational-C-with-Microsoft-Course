The C# Dev Kit extension for Visual Studio Code helps you to install the .NET Software Development Kit (SDK). The .NET SDK is required to run and debug C# applications.

In this exercise, you install the .NET SDK on your computer.

Check to see if .NET is already installed
Use the following steps to complete this section of the exercise:

Ensure that you have Visual Studio Code open.

On the Terminal menu, select New Terminal.

A command prompt, such as C:\Users\AccountName>, should be displayed.

At the command prompt, type: dotnet --version and then press the Enter key.

This command displays the version number if .NET is installed on your PC.

Take a moment to view the response to your dotnet --version command.

If you receive an error message telling you that the term dotnet isn't recognized, the .NET SDK isn't installed.

If a version of .NET is installed, you should see a response message listing the version number similar to the following:

8.0.100

Close the Terminal panel.

Install the .NET 8 SDK
Having the latest supported version of the .NET platform installed is recommended. Although .NET 6 and 7 are also supported, .NET 8 includes improvements that you may find helpful.

Visual Studio Code and the C# Dev Kit help you to install the .NET SDK.

 Note

The C# training series that's available on Microsoft Learn uses .NET 8. Ensure that you have .NET 8 installed if you plan on completing this training.

Use the following steps to complete this section of the exercise:

On the View menu, select Command Palette.

At the Command Palette prompt, type .NET: Install and then select .NET: Install New .NET SDK.

Under Latest, ensure that .NET 8 is selected, and then select Install.

Wait for the .NET SDK to download and install.

The installation process may take a few minutes to complete.

When the installation is complete, close Visual Studio Code.

Verify your installation
Visual Studio Code searches for the .NET SDK when it opens. If the .NET SDK is installed, Visual Studio Code should detect it.

Use the following steps to complete this section of the exercise:

Open Visual Studio Code.

Close the Welcome page, and then open a Terminal panel.

To open a Terminal panel, on the Terminal menu, select New Terminal.

At the Terminal command prompt, type: dotnet --version and then press the Enter key.

You need to open a new command prompt window after installing the .NET SDK to ensure that it's detected.

Verify that a .NET 8 version number is listed.

The version number displayed should be similar to: 8.0.300

You may see a more recent version number, that's okay. The version number will begin with 8. if you installed the .NET 8 SDK.

Close the Terminal panel.

Congratulations on getting .NET installed. You're now ready to start writing, running, and debugging C# applications using Visual Studio Code.
